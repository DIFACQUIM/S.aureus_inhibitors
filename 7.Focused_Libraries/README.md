## 7. Focused Libraries

The similarity scores computed in KNIME (review Article) and machine learning models calculated in [5. Machine Learning Models](GitHub-folder-link) were used to establish a ranking for the three newly generated datasets: INDDS, DIADS, and PYRDS. The mean ppIC<sub>50</sub> values along with the similarity scores were then used to rank potential inhibitors based on both predicted biological potency and structural similarity.

### 7.1 ppIC<sub>50</sub> vs Tanimoto

## Methodology
Visualization of ppIC<sub>50</sub> values vs Tanimoto score were computed on Python 3.12.7 with the following libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and organization.
- **Seaborn**: A data visualization library based on matplotlib.
- **Molplotly**: Built on RDKit which allows 2D images of molecules to be shown in Plotly.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **SciPy**: A collection of mathematical algorithms and convenience functions built on NumPy.
